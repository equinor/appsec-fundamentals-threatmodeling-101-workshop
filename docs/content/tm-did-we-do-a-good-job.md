## Threat Modeling Retrospectives

<div><!-- .element: style="font-size:0.6em"-->

### Do Regular Threat Modeling retrospectives!

- Consider integrating them into regular team retrospectives, or maybe organize dedicated sessions for it.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
</br>(Where do you naturally evaluate topics like quality,standards,security code review++?)

### Potential questions for reflection<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- Did we find any threats?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Should we add goals to our threat modeling, like "2 STRIPED" threats per component?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- How many of the identified threats have we been able to handle? (closed vs open)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- Did our mitigations work?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- Any incidents caused by bugs in our mitigations?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
- Are we (the team) happy with our way of doing threat modeling?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->
- Do we allocate enough time for threat modeling?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" -->
- Is our mechanism for prioritizing working?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9" -->
- Is there any experiments we should try, like other methods?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10" -->
