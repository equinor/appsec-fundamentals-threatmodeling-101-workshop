## Introducing [STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security))/[STRIPED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzOdpuAhr28)

STRIDE is a model for identifying computer security threats. </br>STRIPED is an extension adding "Privacy" to the model with the following mnemonic: <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.65em"-->

 <table style="font-size:0.45em"">

## How to use STRIPED?

<div style="display: grid;grid-column-gap: 1%; grid-auto-columns: 70% 30%;">

<div  style="grid-area: 1 / 1"><!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->
<hr>

- We use S-T-R-I-P-E-D mnemonic to identify threats to system<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Approaches to apply:<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - Trace a user story across the diagram, check for S-T-R-I-P-E-D threats on the way, and refine continuously.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
    - for threat in S-T-R-I-P-E-D <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
      - for element in diagram
        - detail the threat interaction.
  - Concentrate on a specific element or part of the system and assess it against S-T-R-I-P-E-D threats.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
    - for element in diagram<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
      - for threat in S-T-R-I-P-E-D
        - detail the threat interaction.
- Keep improving as you go<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" -->

‚ùóÔ∏èPlenty of frameworks like STRIDE/STRIPED are out there, but we lean into STRIPED when we're getting teams up to speed on Threat Modeling.<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.5em"--><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10" -->

## Tracking threats and assumptions

- Track issues as they are found<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Track assumptions as they are discoverd<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Issues and assumptions are input to the next phase - <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> </br>"What are we going to do about it?"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Recommended practice:<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" --><a style="color:red">Appoint a note taker</a><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
  - Record meetings / sessions<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
  - Create a team strategy for how to </br>document, what to document, where to store ++. </br>Experiment and iterate<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->

<hr>

‚ùóÔ∏èThe best tools are the one that works for the people involved!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" -->

## What could go wrong - brainstorming

(As an alternative to using STRIDE/STRIPED)<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.6em"-->

<div style="font-size:0.9em">

Some useful questions/statements:

- What's the top concern with our system's security? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- If you were to break into our system, how would you do it? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- You know that technical or security issue we've been putting off? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- We rigged up a quick fix last time, didn‚Äôt we? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- So, I was going through the ASVS checklist,</br> how are we doing on that front? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
- Been brushing up on<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" --> [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) ‚Äî are we in the clear? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->

</div>

<hr>

‚ùóÔ∏èThere are many guides and books available discussing the mechanics of threats. There are threats libraries available. It's usually a good idea to augment our threat modeling with these aids„Äùafter„Äûwe have reached a bit of maturity<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" style="font-size:0.8em" -->

## Exercise 2 - Identifying threats

## EX-2: Applying STRIPED

<hr>

<div align="left"><!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->

Tasks:

For our example system, using your DFD for whats currently implemented:

- Examine the system, use cases, components and requirements
- Apply STRIPED, document issues, assumptions and threats
- <a style="color:red">Team decide scope</a>, iterating as you are learning is smart!
- Document format suggested (üëá)
- Take a picture of your documents, share on Slack </br>and prepare to present the model to the class

The person in the group which  <a style="color:magenta">last bought a car</a> becomes group lead for this exercise.

<hr>

‚è∞ Time boxed schedule (30m):

- Apply STRIPED and document threats

<hr>

üí° Try to avoid üê∞ holes. Stop early. Iterate

Assumptions:

- There are no key-stores used
- Storage - VM discs are not encrypted

Issues:

- Should internal traffic be https as well?
- What about PKI infrastructure for http certs?
