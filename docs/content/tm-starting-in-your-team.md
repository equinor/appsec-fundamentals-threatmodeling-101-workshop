<div align="left"><!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->

Group task:

Considering our goals and today's insights, think about these questions:

1. Once you return to your team, what's the first threat modeling suggestion you'd bring up?
2. Identify three major challenges that could hinder integrating threat modeling into your team's workflow.
3. What are the top three advantages your team would gain from engaging in threat modeling?

Take notes. Anonymize if needed. Post result to workshop slack channel [#appsec-threatmodeling-workshop](https://equinor.slack.com/archives/C046T5B84P4).
